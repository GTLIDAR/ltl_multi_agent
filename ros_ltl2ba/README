The LTL2BA software was written by Denis Oddoux and modified by Paul
Gastin.  It is based on the translation algorithm presented at CAV '01:
	P.Gastin and D.Oddoux
	"Fast LTL to Büchi Automata Translation" 
	in 13th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification, CAV 2001, 
	G. Berry, H. Comon, A. Finkel (Eds.)
	Paris, France, July 18-22, 2001, 
	Proceedings - LNCS 2102, pp. 53-65

Part of the code included is issued from the SPIN software Version 3.4.1
The SPIN software is written by Gerard J. Holzmann, originally as part
of ``Design and Validation of Protocols,'' ISBN 0-13-539925-4,
1991, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632
Here are the files that contain some code from Spin v3.4.1 :

	cache.c  (originally tl_cache.c)
	lex.c    (           tl_lex.c  )
	ltl2ba.h (           tl.h      )
	main.c   (           tl_main.c )
	mem.c.   (           tl_mem.c  )
	parse.c  (           tl_parse.c)
	rewrt.c  (           tl_rewrt.c)
	trans.c	 (           tl_trans.c)

2. COMPILING

Compile using catkin
from your workspace:
> catkin_make
or
> catkin build ltl2ba

Source
> source devel/setup.bash

3. EXECUTING

run the program
> rosrun ltl2ba ltl2ba -f 'formula'

The formula is an LTL formula, and may contain propositional symbols, 
boolean operators, temporal operators, and parentheses.
The syntax used is the one used in the 'Spin' model-checker

Propositonal Symbols:
        true, false
        any lowercase string

Boolean operators:
        !   (negation)
        ->  (implication)
        <-> (equivalence)
        &&  (and)
        ||  (or)

Temporal operators:
        []  (always)
        <>  (eventually)
        U   (until)
        V   (release)
        X   (next)

Use spaces between any symbols.

The result is a never claim in Promela that can be given to the
Spin model checker to verify properties on a system.

run the command
> rosrun ltl2ba ltl2ba
to see the possible options for executing the program

4. CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1

- fixing a bug in the way sets were used for strongly connected components. Thanks to Joachim Klein (klein@tcs.inf.tu-dresden.de) who found the bug and proposed a patch to fix it.
- fixing a bug in the simplification with strongly connected components for the generalized Büchi automaton. 
- improving the simplification with strongly connected components for the generalized Büchi automaton.
- using getrusage to compute running times for the statistics
- some other minor updates.

5. CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3

Thanks to Jerry James for the patches addressing the following issues
- compatibility with gcc 10 (link-time failure for identically named 
variables in different files)
- Remove unused function and variable declarations
- Make (f)printf format declarations match the types of the corresponding expressions
- Remove the second argument to Fatal(), fatal() and non_fatal(), since it is always NULL
- Make main() return something (since it is supposed to return int)
